    <h2>Project Genesis</h2>
    <p>
      This project is an extension of our work from IDM215 where we designed a food truck app in Figma. Though now we are creating a live version using PHP, HTML, and CSS. Our goal this time around was to work together as a team, take ownership of our individual responsibilities, and ultimately build a fully functional web application. Over the course of 11 weeks, we collaborated across different roles—designers (UX and UI), developers (Front-end and Back-end), and a project manager—to make it happen. We chose to focus on Nanus Hot Chicken because most of our team members had previous experience working with that food truck, which gave us a solid foundation to build on.

    <h2>Design Evolution</h2>
    <p>
      Since most of the design work was already done in IDM215, the app didn’t change much throughout this project. Most of the updates we made were focused on adapting the design to work as a live site and figuring out solutions for the challenges that came with development.

    <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
    <p>
      One of the first technical challenges we faced was learning how to collaborate as developers, since it was our first time coding together on the same project. Over time, we figured out how to contribute effectively and work as a team. Another big hurdle was setting up the database for the live site—we had trouble deciding on a hosting platform but eventually went with Bluehost because of its phpMyAdmin support. For me personally, adjusting to a Git-based workflow was a bit tricky at first, especially with the way I had set up Bluehost. We ended up solving that by integrating an auto-deployment system into our GitHub repo and having all developers push to the main branch.

    <h2>Project Insights</h2>
    <p>
      We managed the project using Microsoft Teams, where our project manager set up a weekly task list with deadlines for each role. Starting in week 5, we began holding weekly Monday meetings to go over our progress and figure out what to focus on next. Most of our communication happened through a group text, but the developers also had a separate Discord group where we could dive deeper into coding discussions.

    <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
    <p>
      I learned that when working on a live site with a database, it's crucial to regularly update from local to live to avoid issues down the line. Creating a safe environment for both versions is key, and it’s important to really understand the systems you’re working with since each one can have its quirks. And using a Git-based workflow was super helpful because it kept track of every change, making it easy to roll back if something went wrong. I also realized how important communication is when coding as a team—since everyone’s pushing code to the same project, even small changes can cause problems if we're not on the same page.
