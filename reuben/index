      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>For this group project, our development team was tasked with building a responsive web application for
        <strong>Nanu’s Hot Chicken</strong>, a food truck known for their spicy chicken offerings. The project ran from
        January to March 2025, and as one of the developers, I collaborated closely with UX and UI designers to bring the app to life.</p>

      <h2>Development Objectives</h2>
      <p>Our main goals were to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create an intuitive interface that allowed users to browse the menu, customize orders, and easily check out.</li>
        <li>Develop a fully responsive web app based on Figma designs, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile.</li>
        <li>Enhance customer satisfaction through user testing, gathering feedback to refine the app’s functionality and flow.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
      <p>The app was built primarily with <strong>PHP</strong> to handle back-end logic and <strong>JavaScript</strong> for interactive front-end components. We structured the project to handle dynamic menu data, order customizations, and efficient checkout processing.</p>
      <p>Our CSS styling leaned heavily on bold fonts and a color palette reflecting Nanu’s branding, while media queries ensured responsiveness across devices.</p>

      <h2>Challenges and Collaboration</h2>
      <p>One of the biggest challenges as a developer was integrating the PHP back-end with the front-end design while keeping the experience smooth and responsive. Close collaboration with the design team helped us align on functionality and make necessary adjustments quickly.</p>
      <p>Regular team check-ins, along with using a Kanban board for task management, allowed us to stay on track and support each other effectively throughout the process.</p>

      <h2>User Testing & Results</h2>
      <p>We conducted rounds of user testing focused on menu navigation and the ordering process. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive — users found the app intuitive and easy to navigate.</p>
      <p>Based on testing insights, we made small adjustments to improve the ordering flow and mobile responsiveness, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.</p>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>This project was a valuable experience in full-stack web development within a collaborative team environment. Working alongside designers helped me better understand the importance of user experience when building out features. It was rewarding to see how our combined efforts resulted in an app that felt simple, functional, and aligned with the client’s goals.</p>
