      <h1>Case Study: Nanu's Hot Chicken Food Truck App</h1>
  
      <section>
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>Over the course of <strong>11 weeks</strong>, I worked with a team of six to develop an app for <strong>Nanu&apos;s Hot Chicken Food Truck</strong>. We were given a pre-made design and tasked with bringing it to life through development. While my official role was listed as “<strong>support</strong>,” I primarily focused on <strong>front-end development</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <p>My main goals were to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Bring a Design Concept to Life</strong></li>
          <p>Transform the provided design for Nanu&apos;s Hot Chicken Food Truck into a fully functional, user-friendly app through collaborative development.</p>
          <li><strong>Strengthen Front-End Development Skills</strong></li>
          <p>Apply and enhance my front-end development skills by building responsive interfaces, implementing design elements, and ensuring a smooth user experience.</p>
          <li><strong>Collaborate Effectively in a Team Setting</strong></li>
          <p>Work closely with a team of six to communicate, problem-solve, and manage tasks efficiently over the course of an 11-week development cycle.</p>
        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges and Collaboration</h2>
        <p>One of the biggest challenges us as developers faced was staying organized—especially when it came to version control. With three people working on the same codebase, things could easily get messy if we weren&apos;t careful. We had to stay on top of naming conventions and making sure no one was overwriting eachother&apos;s work. There were definitely a few bumps early on, but we eventually found a good rhythm by communicating clearly about who was doing what. Staying organized wasn&apos;t just helpful—it was essential to keeping the project moving smoothly.</p>

        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>My role on the team was officially listed as “<strong>support</strong>,” but I ended up spending most of my time working on the <strong>front-end</strong>. I focused on turning the design mockups into real, interactive screens that users could actually click through and use. I built out styled pages to match the our Figma file, and helped make sure everything was <strong>responsive</strong> and easy to navigate. I also jumped in to help troubleshoot bugs and support other teammates when needed. Even though I wasn't the main developer, I really owned a big part of the front-end experience and kept everything looking clean and functional.</p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>Looking back, this project taught me a lot more than just front-end development. It really showed me how important <strong>communication, organization, and teamwork</strong> are when building something with others. There were definitely some challenges, but figuring those things out together made the whole experience more rewarding. I also gained a lot of confidence in my coding skills and realized how much I enjoy bringing designs to life.</p>
